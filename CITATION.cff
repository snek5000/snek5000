title: "Snek5000: Computational Fluid Dynamics with Python and Nek5000"
abstract: |
  Snek5000 is a Python package which allows one to write Fluidsim solvers based
  for the simulations on the Fortran CFD code Nek5000. With a Snek5000-Fluidsim
  solver, it becomes very easy to (i) launch/restart simulations with Python scripts
  and (ii) load simulations, read the associated parameters/data and
  produce nice figures/movies.
